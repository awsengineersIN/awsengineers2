Spring Boot Default Port in ECS Containers
Yes, I can confirm the default port for Spring Boot applications running within ECS containers. Spring Boot applications run on port 8080 by default, and this remains true whether they're running in a local environment or within containerized environments like AWS ECS.

Default Port Configuration
Spring Boot applications use port 8080 as their default embedded Tomcat server port. This default applies regardless of whether the application is running:

Locally on your development machine

In a Docker container

On AWS ECS with Fargate or EC2 launch types

The embedded Tomcat server that comes with Spring Boot is preconfigured to listen on port 8080, as confirmed by the official Spring Boot documentation.

Port Configuration in ECS Context
When deploying Spring Boot applications to AWS ECS, you need to properly configure port mappings in your task definition:

For ECS with Fargate (awsvpc network mode):
Container Port: Set to 8080 (or your custom port)

Host Port: Leave blank or set to the same value as container port

The host port is automatically set to match the container port in awsvpc mode

For ECS with EC2 instances:
Container Port: 8080 (Spring Boot's internal port)

Host Port: Can be set to a specific value or 0 for dynamic port assignment

Port mappings allow external traffic to reach your containerized Spring Boot application

Customizing the Default Port
While 8080 is the default, you can easily change this by:

1. Using application.properties:```properties
server.port=9090

text

**2. Using application.yml:**
```yaml
server:
  port: 9090
3. Using environment variables in Docker/ECS:

text
SERVER_PORT=9090
4. Using command-line arguments:

bash
java -jar myapp.jar --server.port=9090
ECS Port Mapping Example
When deploying to ECS, your task definition should include port mapping configuration like this:

json
"portMappings": [
  {
    "containerPort": 8080,
    "hostPort": 8080,
    "protocol": "tcp"
  }
]
For Fargate deployments, the host port will automatically match the container port when using awsvpc networking mode.

Important Considerations
Docker EXPOSE directive: While you can expose port ranges in your Dockerfile, the Spring Boot application still needs to be configured to listen on the desired port

Load Balancer Integration: When using Application Load Balancers with ECS, ensure your target group health checks point to the correct port where your Spring Boot application is listening

Security Groups: Don't forget to configure security groups to allow inbound traffic on port 8080 (or your custom port) for your ECS tasks

The default port 8080 is well-established and widely used across Spring Boot deployments, making it the standard choice for most applications unless there's a specific requirement to use a different port.

Changing Spring Boot Port to 8443 in ECS Fargate
To change your Spring Boot application from the default port 8080 to port 8443 in ECS Fargate, you need to update both your Spring Boot application configuration and your ECS task definition.

Spring Boot Configuration Changes
Option 1: Using application.properties
Add this line to your src/main/resources/application.properties file:```properties
server.port=8443

text

**Option 2: Using application.yml**
Add this configuration to your `src/main/resources/application.yml` file:
```yaml
server:
  port: 8443
Option 3: Using Environment Variables (Recommended for containers)
Set the SERVER_PORT environment variable in your container configuration:

text
SERVER_PORT=8443
Option 4: Using Command Line Arguments
If running as a JAR file:

bash
java -jar myapp.jar --server.port=8443
ECS Fargate Task Definition Configuration
For ECS Fargate, you need to update your task definition's port mapping configuration. Since Fargate uses awsvpc networking mode, you only need to specify the containerPort. The hostPort is automatically set to match the container port.

Task Definition JSON Example:

json
{
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "my-spring-boot-app",
      "image": "my-app:latest",
      "portMappings": [
        {
          "containerPort": 8443,
          "protocol": "tcp"
        }
      ],
      "environment": [
        {
          "name": "SERVER_PORT",
          "value": "8443"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
Important Considerations for Port 8443
Potential Redirect Issues:
Be aware that port 8443 is commonly associated with HTTPS, and Spring Security has built-in behavior that may cause redirects to port 8443 when using HTTP. This is due to Spring Security's PortResolverImpl which attempts to work around IE browser bugs. If you're running HTTP (not HTTPS) on port 8443, you might experience unexpected redirects.

Solutions for HTTP on 8443:

Use a different port - Consider using a port other than 8443 for HTTP applications (e.g., 8080, 9090, etc.)

Configure HTTPS properly - If using port 8443, consider configuring SSL/TLS properly

Disable Spring Security's port mapping - Override the default port mapping behavior if needed

Load Balancer Configuration
If you're using an Application Load Balancer (ALB) with your ECS service:

Target Group Configuration:

Target Type: IP (required for Fargate with awsvpc networking)

Protocol/Port: HTTP/8443 or HTTPS/8443 depending on your setup

Health Check Path: Configure appropriate health check endpoint

VPC: Same VPC as your ECS service

ALB Listener Configuration:

json
{
  "Port": 443,
  "Protocol": "HTTPS",
  "DefaultActions": [
    {
      "Type": "forward",
      "TargetGroupArn": "arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:..."
    }
  ]
}
Security Group Configuration
Ensure your security groups allow traffic on port 8443:

ECS Service Security Group:

Inbound Rule: Allow TCP port 8443 from ALB security group (or appropriate source)

Outbound Rule: Allow all outbound traffic (or as needed)

Complete Example
Here's a complete example of the changes needed:

1. application.yml:

text
server:
  port: 8443
2. ECS Task Definition:

json
{
  "family": "my-spring-boot-task",
  "networkMode": "awsvpc",
  "requiresCompatibilities": ["FARGATE"],
  "cpu": "256",
  "memory": "512",
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "spring-boot-container",
      "image": "my-spring-boot-app:latest",
      "portMappings": [
        {
          "containerPort": 8443,
          "protocol": "tcp"
        }
      ],
      "environment": [
        {
          "name": "SERVER_PORT",
          "value": "8443"
        }
      ],
      "essential": true
    }
  ]
}
The key points are: configure Spring Boot to listen on port 8443, update your ECS task definition to expose port 8443, and ensure your load balancer and security groupsre configured appropriately.

What is option #2?
What is option #2?
Looking at my previous response, Option 2 was using application.yml to configure the Spring Boot port.

Here's the specific configuration for Option 2:

Using application.yml:
Add this configuration to your src/main/resources/application.yml file:

text
server:
  port: 8443
This is the YAML format alternative to using the properties file format. Instead of using application.properties with the syntax server.port=8443, you use the YAML format in application.yml with the hierarchical structure shown above.

Both approaches achieve the same result - they configure your Spring Boot application to run on port 8443 instead of the default port 8080. The choice between .properties and .yml format is largely a matter of preference, though YAML format can be more readable for complex configurations due to its hierarchical structure.
